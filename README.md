Basic build instructions
------------------------

(for more detailed instructions, see [the development page][ppsspp-devel])

First of all, after having checked out the source, don't forget to
run:

    git submodule update --init
 
in order to get the "native" library.

Now, the actual building:

Building for Windows
---------------------

Use Visual Studio 2010+, Visual C++ Express is fine. Open the solution and just build,
it'll work. You may just need to set up a path or two to the Windows SDK (which includes the DX SDK)
nowadays.


Building for Android
--------------------

Install the Android SDK and NDK.

To build the native C/C++ part, from a shell or command prompt, run:

    ./ab.sh 

or, on Windows:

    ab.cmd 

in android/. You may need to tweak the paths in the ab file.

Then just open the project in Eclipse and run on your device. When you make changes to
the native code, you may have to refresh or add a few spaces to PPSSPPActivity.java for
Eclipse to rebuild the APK when you run it on your device the next time.

There's an alternate method of building for Android using CMake below.


Other platforms
---------------

PPSSPP currently uses CMake for its build system. In order
to build for most systems, create a `build` directory and
run:

    cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

Alternatively, run b.sh which will create the directory for you.

You can specify the -G parameter to cmake to choose a generator.
The `NMake Makefiles`, `Visual Studio 11` (projects + sln),
`GNU Makefiles` and `Unix Makefiles` generators have been tested.

Of course in-tree builds are supported, but that makes cleanup
harder to do; with out-of-tree builds you can just remove the
`build` directory.

Note: There is also a Qt frontend available. Simply open
PPSSPPQt.pro in [Qt Creator 2.6+][qt-creator] and press run. The
Qt frontend currently supports Windows, Linux, Blackberry 10,
Symbian and Meego.

Building for Linux/BSD/Meego Harmattan/Pandora/etc
--------------------------

Qt (recommended)

A Qt-based frontend is available in the Qt/ dir.
Open PPSSPPQt.pro with [Qt Creator 2.6+][qt-creator].
Install libsdl1.2 if you want to use USB Gamepad.
If the build has an error about finding mobility or multimedia:
- Install the package "qtmobility-dev"

SDL

Alternatively, install the libsdl1.2 (SDL 1.2) development headers. This is called `libsdl1.2-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `SDL-devel` on Fedora/RHEL,
`sdl12` on BSD ports.

You will need a recent version of ffmpeg (1.1 or greater, which means libav 9.1 or greater probably) or development packets (for distributions with separate packets) for libavformat, libavcodec, libswresample and libswscale (still version 9.1 or greater).

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse.

Building for OSX
----------------

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools and, using macports, fink or
homebrew, install the SDL development headers. This is called `sdl`
on homebrew. Just follow the basic build instructions afterwards.

Currently the user interface is identical to Android's, operated
with the mouse. A Qt-based interface is planned.

Building for Android using CMake (not recommended, see above)
-------------------------------------------------------------

To build for Android using CMake, first you must set the ANDROID\_NDK environment
variable to point to the path of your NDK install. This is done on
windows cmd with `set ANDROID_NDK=X:\...`, on bourne shells with
`export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/ndk`, and on C shells with
`setenv ANDROID_NDK /path/to/ndk`.

Create a `build-android` directory and inside it run:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/ppsspp/android/android.toolchain.cmake path/to/ppsspp
    make

After `make` finishes, it will have created the needed .so files in
path/to/ppsspp/android/libs/armeabi-v7a. You can now use the build.xml
in the android/ dir to build the final executable, or import the android/
folder as an existing project in Eclipse.

Note that Eclipse won't notice if you have made changes to the C++ code.
Introduce a meaningless change to a random .java file such as a whitespace
to get Eclipse to rebuild the project.

Also note that the `Visual Studio` generators aren't compatible with compilers
other than Microsoft's, but `NMake Makefiles` works fine.

Building for iOS
----------------

Create a `build-ios` directory and inside it run:

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../ios/ios.toolchain.cmake -GXcode ..

Then open the generated project in Xcode.

For more information, see: http://code.google.com/p/ios-cmake/wiki/HowTo

Building for Blackberry
-----------------------

To build for Blackberry, you must first have the [latest Native SDK][blackberry-ndk] installed.

To set up your environment for cross-compiling you must then use:

    source ~/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh

Finally, you are ready to compile. Go to ppsspp/Blackberry/ and run:

    ./build.sh

If you are on Windows, you will need GNU and CMake to run the bash script.

Alternatively, you can use the Qt frontend by compiling the PPSSPPQt.pro in
the Qt/ directory with `qmake` from the NDK or [QtCreator 2.6+][qt-creator].

Building for Symbian
--------------------

To build for Symbian, you require:

1) [GCC 4.6.3][symbian-gcc] from Mentor Graphics.

2) Symbian Qt libraries. You can find these in the final Nokia Qt SDK or online.

3) Set up your SDK to use Symbian GCCE 4.6.3. See a tutorial here: http://www.summeli.fi/?p=4220
You will need to add the GCCE 4.6.3 variant to Symbian\tools\sbs\lib\config\variants.xml as follows:

```
    <var name="gcce4_6_3" extends="gcce_base">
      <env name="SBS_GCCE463BIN" type="toolchainpath" />
      <set name="GCCEBIN" value="$(SBS_GCCE463BIN)" />
      <set name="GCCECC" value="$(GCCEBIN)/arm-none-symbianelf-g++$(DOTEXE)" type="tool" versionCommand="$(GCCECC) -dumpversion" versionResult="4.6.3"/>
      <set name="RUNTIME_LIBS_LIST" value="drtaeabi.dso dfpaeabi.dso"/>
      <set name="PLATMACROS.VAR" value="GCCE_4 GCCE_4_6"/>
      <set name="ARMMACROS.VAR" value="__GCCE_4__ __GCCE_4_6__"/>
      <set name="LINKER_DEFAULT_LIBS" value="-lsupc++ -lgcc -lgcc_eh"/>
      <set name="PLATMACROS.CONFIG" value="ARMV6"/>
      <set name="ARMMACROS.CONFIG" value="__MARM_ARMV6__ __ARMV6__"/>
      <set name="LINKER_GROUP_END_OPTION" value="-Wl,--end-group"/>
      <set name="LINKER_GROUP_START_OPTION" value="-Wl,--start-group"/>
      <set name="CC.ARMV5" value="-march=armv6"/>
      <set name="CC.SOFTVFP_MAYBE_VFPV2" value="softfp"/>
    </var>
```

You will also need to increase the data section of the executable in linking stage by modifying Symbian\tools\sbs\lib\config\gcce.xml as follows:

```
    <set name="RW_BASE" value="$(RW_BASE_OPTION)0x3000000"/>
```

Then simply compile the PPSSPPQt.pro with `qmake` from the SDK or the included QtCreator.
